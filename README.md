🔥 Algeria Forest Fire Prediction
A web-based machine learning application to predict Fire Weather Index (FWI) and fire occurrence probability in Algerian forests using key meteorological and vegetation indices. Built with Flask, HTML/CSS, and trained on real Algeria forest data.

📌 Project Overview
Wildfires pose a serious threat to Algeria’s forest ecosystems. This project applies machine learning to predict the likelihood of forest fires based on parameters like:
Temperature
Relative Humidity (RH)
Wind Speed (WS)
Rainfall
FFMC (Fine Fuel Moisture Code)
DMC (Duff Moisture Code)
ISI (Initial Spread Index)
Vegetation Classes
Region (Bejaia/Sidi Bel Abbes)

🚀 Features
🌡️ Input weather & vegetation data via a web form
🔍 Predict FWI or fire occurrence using a trained ML model
📊 Clean and responsive interface using Bootstrap
🔁 Built with Flask for backend routing and logic

🧠 Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Flask (Web framework)
Scikit-learn / Pandas / NumPy (ML & data processing)
HTML/CSS + Bootstrap (Frontend)
Jinja2 (Template rendering)
